Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository!
Here, I’m documenting the problems I’ve solved while learning Data Structures & Algorithms in Java. This repo reflects my growth through consistent practice and understanding of core DSA concepts.


✅ Topics Covered So Far:

🔍 Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search (1D & 2D), Rotated Binary Search

📊 Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Cyclic Sort, Quick Sort

🔁 Recursion: Patterns, Subsets, Subsequences, String-based recursion, Backtracking (Permutations, Maze problems)

⚙️ Bit Manipulation: XOR, Binary tricks

🧠 Math & Simulation problems
